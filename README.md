# PhD_HPC_Scripts
HPC and data reduction and graphing scripts from my PhD work.

Setup a python environment using the `./install.sh` script.
This requires an active python3.9 instalation, accessable from the `python` command.
This script can be run from any location, but it is recomended to run within the cloned repo.  

Access all commands by sourcing the .command_aliases file.
